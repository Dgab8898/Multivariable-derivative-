# Multivariable-derivative-
Finding the derivation of two variable
 In mathematics, a partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant

 Partial derivatives appear in any optimisation problem with more than one choice variable. For example, in economic to maximise profit with respect to the choice of the quantities x and y of two different types of output.
, another field such as quantum mechanics as Schrodinger wave equation, as well as mathematical physics.
In this project we demonstrate how to find multivariable derivative in respect to one variable at a time.\
This solution can be applied in profit maximisation, production and consumption.

- we will take the derivative with respect to x while we treat y like it’s constant. 
- Then we’ll take another derivative of the original function, this one with respect to y, and we’ll treat x as a constant.
- In that way, we sort of reduce the problem to a single-variable derivative problem.
